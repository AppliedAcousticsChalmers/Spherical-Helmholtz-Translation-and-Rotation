"""Implementations for the spherical bessel functions.

Currently this is based on the implementations for spherical bessel functions
in scipy. The disadvantage with the scipy implementations is that any recurrence
relations are used for each order input. Since we typically need a set of
arguments evaluted for all orders, it would be more efficient to only apply
the recurrence relations ones to get all orders.

It is preferrable to use the functions here for their intended purposes, since
they might be re-implemented to suit our specialized needs at some point.
